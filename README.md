**NNTPChan** (previously known as overchan) is a decentralized imageboard that uses the [NNTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol) (network-news transfer protocol) to synchronize content between many different servers. It utilizes cryptographically signed posts to perform optional/opt-in decentralized moderation.

## Getting started

[This](doc) is a step-by-step guide for getting up-and-running with NNTPChan as well as documentation for developers who want to either work on NNTPChan directly or use NNTPChan in their aplications with the API.

TL;DR edition:


    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install --no-install-recommends install imagemagick ffmpeg sox build-essential git ca-certificates postgresql postgresql-client golang
    $ git clone https://github.com/nntpchan/nntpchan
    $ cd nntpchan
